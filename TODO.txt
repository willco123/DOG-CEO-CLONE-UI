Figure out why text isnt wrapping for dog-wrapper, but is for navbar,
something to do with flex-direction perhaps
DOG ceo never allows for horizontal scrolling, figure out why

Having a set height caused sticky not to work
Changing NavBar to fixed, fixed the issues.
horizontal scrolling never occurss when the window shrinks
likewise the text now wraps itself
However the element is no longer in the document flow
Probably to do with how sticky works, no idea really, save for future learning
